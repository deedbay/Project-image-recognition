# Project-image-recognition

Project made in collaboration with Florian Darg√®re during my internship in the Poyltech Tours' computer science laboratory.
The goal is to make an interactive program for the science fair which allows users to draw an object within a list of x objects.
This drawing will then be processed by a CNN made using tensorflow 2.0 beta. The output probabilities will in the end be displayed in a GUI.
